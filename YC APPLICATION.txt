How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

We met five months ago through a mutual friend at a club. Soon after, we took a trip together to Chakrata, a hill station in Uttarakhand, India. During that trip, we connected deeply and discovered a strong alignment in our working styles, values, and complementary skills. Since then, we've been collaborating closely and have developed a strong co-founder relationship. Both founders have met and worked together in person.

Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

All coding and technical work has been done by the two founders. I have primarily worked on building the tool interface, setting up the database, and developing the backend. My co-founder, who has a strong background in Robotic Process Automation (RPA), has focused on document processing, parsing, and implementing automations such as invoice parsing and email classification. No non-founder has contributed to the technical work.

Are you looking for a cofounder?

No, we are not looking for a co-founder. We believe we have the capabilities required to lead the company effectively. Both of us bring complementary skills in technical development and business understanding. We developed the business idea together after deeply discussing the intricacies of the problem we aim to solve. My co-founder has significant experience in the corporate sector, including managerial roles, and has worked with SaaS companies where she also pitched products to prospective customers. We’re confident in both our vision and execution — not only to build the product but also to take it to market effectively. With our combined experience in technical development, automation, and SaaS product delivery, we’re well-positioned to lead the company.

AI + RPA-based automation for ERP systems

What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.

We’re building an intelligent automation platform designed to integrate seamlessly with ERP systems like SAP, NetSuite, and others, with the goal of transforming complex business workflows such as procurement, accounts payable, and contract handling. Our platform doesn't just follow rule-based automation — it leverages AI models to understand the context of business documents and processes, enabling it to make intelligent decisions that traditionally require human intervention.

Most ERP systems are robust but inherently complex, often requiring trained professionals for even basic operations. While many automation tools in the market handle standard, rule-based tasks, they fall short when it comes to dynamic processes involving judgment, exceptions, or contextual interpretation. That’s where our solution stands apart.

For example, invoice processing is a critical yet time-consuming task. Typically, it takes 10–15 minutes per invoice due to manual entry, cross-verification of PO and GRN data, and ensuring compliance. Our tool can process and validate the same invoice in seconds by using advanced AI models trained on domain-specific data to extract, interpret, and validate information intelligently — reducing processing time, eliminating human error, and freeing up workforce bandwidth.

We aim to offer Automation-as-a-Service, providing a plug-and-play intelligent automation layer that can sit on top of any enterprise system. This layer will not only accelerate operations but also deliver better accuracy, transparency, and scalability — with a user-friendly UI that requires minimal training or technical expertise to use.

Our platform is designed for real-world enterprise use, where business logic is nuanced, and where intelligent decision-making is critical — not just process mapping and scripting.

Explain your decision regarding location.

We’re incorporating in Gurugram, Haryana — a thriving northern‑India tech centre. As long‑time residents, we benefit from the city’s strategic proximity to Delhi and the airport, its dense ecosystem of MNCs and startups, and strong government policies supporting startups. Gurugram offers a deep, skilled talent pool, competitive real estate costs, access to corporate partnerships, and a high quality of life that makes it ideal for technology-driven innovation and scaling.

How far along are you?

We are currently building the procurement module of our platform. So far, we’ve developed core workflows including:

Login System

Creating and approving purchase requisitions

Vendor onboarding and approvals

Request for quotations and approvals

Purchase order creation and approval

Invoice parsing and 3-way matching using automation

In addition, we are working on user-friendly UI with an interactive dashboard, and core interface elements of the tool.


How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

We conceived the idea in June 2025 and began working on the overall structure and skeleton of the tool. Since July 1st, we’ve been actively focused on development. I am working full-time on the project, while my co-founder, who is currently employed at an MNC, is contributing part-time. In addition to supporting technical development, she also helps sustain the project financially and ensures a stable income stream.

What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product? Include AI models and AI coding tools you use.

We are using React for the front end, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database — aligning with modern development standards to build a scalable and high-quality product.

For automation, we are integrating RPA tools such as Microsoft Power Automate to handle repetitive business workflows.

On the AI side, we plan to fine-tune pre-trained transformer models (such as BERT, RoBERTa, or LayoutLM) on our domain-specific data. This will power several key capabilities, including:

Email classification and routing

Document understanding and information extraction

Invoice parsing and entity recognition

3-way matching across documents (e.g., invoice, PO, GRN)

Intent detection and contextual response generation for business queries

Intelligent approval routing based on historical data

Anomaly detection in transactional data

Automated summarization of lengthy business documents

Both founders have a strong foundation in Python and are proficient in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and relevant frameworks.


When will you have a version people can use?

We are currently developing core business process modules that are common across industries, such as procurement and accounts payable. A basic version with RPA functionality will be ready for demos and pilot deployments within the next 1–2 months.

In Phase 1, we plan to showcase these modules to organizations and onboard early adopters for process-specific automation. Since business workflows often vary, we’ll tailor automation pipelines to each client's needs.

In Phase 2, we’ll incorporate AI by training models on customer-specific data to enhance accuracy in tasks like document parsing, email classification, and 3-way matching. We may also offer integrations with external AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT models) depending on the client's use case.

Our goal is to have the first version in active use by real customers within the next 2–3 months.

Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

We chose this idea by first identifying our strengths, skills, and interests. I come from a legal background and was exploring the development of an AI-powered contract analysis tool, having often dealt with drafting and interpreting contracts. My co-founder, on the other hand, has hands-on experience building RPA solutions using tools like Power Automate and UiPath, and has been involved in automating business processes within her organization.

During our discussions, we realized that many of the tasks we were tackling—whether contract review or process automation—shared a common thread: they were repetitive, rule-based, and time-consuming. We saw a clear opportunity to apply AI and RPA to streamline such tasks, not just in legal work, but across broader business operations.

My co-founder often received internal requests from different departments asking for automation solutions, and I saw firsthand how legal contracts, despite having similar structures, still consumed a lot of manual effort. This helped us validate the real-world demand for automation in enterprise workflows.

With my technical skills in backend, frontend, and database development, and her experience in designing and deploying RPA workflows in an enterprise environment, we decided to build a user-friendly, modular tool that delivers Automation-as-a-Service. What started with contract analysis evolved into a broader vision for automating business processes across industries.

Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?

Companies like UiPath, Nividous, Infosys, and TCS are our indirect competitors—they offer process automation either as a platform or a service. However, these tools require significant training, technical configuration, and high licensing costs, making them inaccessible for non-technical users or small to mid-size businesses.

Our key insight is that automation doesn’t need to be complex or intimidating. We’re building a user-friendly automation tool that abstracts the complexity of RPA and AI beneath a clean, intuitive interface. Business users can operate our tool without training, unlike traditional tools that require dedicated automation engineers or IT teams.

We also don’t force businesses into rigid platform architectures. Instead, we deliver custom-built solutions using affordable tools (like React, Node, Mongo, Power Automate) to automate exactly what the client needs. This makes our offering not just easier to adopt, but also more flexible, faster to deploy, and scalable without bloated costs.

Our product sits in the sweet spot between no-code simplicity and full-scale automation power—giving enterprises automation without the overhead.Companies like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Infosys, and TCS are our indirect competitors—they offer process automation either as a platform or a service.

How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

We follow a service-based revenue model by offering Automation-as-a-Service, focusing on automating business processes such as procurement, accounts payable, and contract workflows. Our clients will pay for:

Initial Setup & Customization: Based on the complexity of their business process and integrations (e.g., with SAP, NetSuite, etc.).

Subscription-based Usage: Monthly or yearly fee to access and use the tool with selected RPA workflows and AI features.

AI Model Hosting or Integration: Optional add-ons for custom-trained AI models or integration with tools like OpenAI via APIs.

Support & Maintenance: Tiered support pricing based on SLAs.

We’re targeting mid-size to large enterprises with high manual workload in legacy ERP systems. For example, an enterprise known to us recently purchased a customized invoice automation tool from a leading vendor (focused on accounts payable and invoice parsing) for ₹1.5 crore (~$180,000), validating both the need and the price point in this space.

We believe we can deliver similar or better automation capabilities with significantly improved usability and lower onboarding cost due to our intuitive UI and modular design. Over time, with just 50 enterprise clients in India alone, we estimate annual revenue potential of $4M–$5M, with international scalability multiplying this further.

If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder and founder title (e.g. CEO). (This question is as much for you as us.)

We have two co-founders:

Muskan – CEO – 50% equity

Devansh Garg – CTO – 50% equity

As of now, we have not formed the company yet. We plan to split equity equally as we have both contributed significantly to the ideation, product development, and direction of the company. We currently have no employees or external shareholders. Future equity allocations (e.g., for early employees or advisors) will be decided as we grow.

What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?

I was self-convinced to apply to Y Combinator after seeing the transformative impact it had on a founder I know, who went through the program and built a highly successful startup. Their journey showed me the value YC brings — not just in funding, but in mentorship, structure, and a community of ambitious builders. I have not attended any YC events, but I’ve followed YC's content and strongly believe the program can accelerate both our product and our growth trajectory.

How did you hear about Y Combinator?

I first heard about Y Combinator from a founder I know who went through the program and went on to build a successful startup.
